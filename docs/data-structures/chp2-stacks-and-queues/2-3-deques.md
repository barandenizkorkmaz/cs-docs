# 3. Deque

### Overview

- The name deque (pronounced "deck") is short for double‚Äêended queue, which means that it is a data structure that allows insertions and removals from both ends (front and rear).



### Interface `java.util.Deque<E>`

| `E`                     | `element()`                       | Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue represented by this deque. |
| `E`                     | `getFirst()`                      | Retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of this deque. |
| `E`                     | `getLast()`                       | Retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of this deque. |
| `boolean`               | `removeFirstOccurrence(Object o)` | Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this deque. |
| `boolean`               | `removeLastOccurrence(Object o)`  | Removes the last occurrence of the specified element from this deque. |
| `int`                   | `size()`                          | Returns the number of elements in this deque.                |
| `Iterator<E>`           | `iterator()`                      | Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in proper sequence. |
| `Iterator<E>`           | `descendingIterator()`            | Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in reverse sequential order. |
| `boolean`               | `contains(Object o)`              | Returns true if this deque contains the specified element.   |
| `void`                  | `push(E e)`                       | Pushes an element onto the stack represented by this deque (at the head) if space is available, throws IllegalStateException if no space is available. |

### Implementation

- The Java Collections Framework provides four implementations of the Deque interface, including **ArrayDeque** and **LinkedList**.
    - ArrayDeque utilizes a **resizable circular array** like our class **ArrayQueue** and is the **recommended** implementation because, unlike **LinkedList, it does not support indexed operations.**
